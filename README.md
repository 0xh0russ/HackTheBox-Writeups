# 0xh0russ's HtB Notes

## What this is

This is a collection of my own personal notes that I take while working through HackTheBox machines. I am taking these notes because I am trying to improve my note taking skills because these are essential for vulnerability research and penetration testing.

Another reason why I keep these notes is to be able to reflect on my methodology and the decisions I make while working a machine. This lets me reflect on my mistakes and find how to be more efficient and avoid rabbit holes. Even if I don't end up making a conscious effort to reflect on my methods this will still be beneficial because:

## General Format

These writeups will generally follow the same template to make them easier for me to manage and easier for you to navigate (I don't know if I'll even make these public). 
That being said, I will include dead-ends and rabbit holes that I went down so there might be a little bit of *noise* in there. I'll try to use **bold** or ==highlight== or something to emphasize the good stuff.

## Structure

I will dump all the writeups in markdown format in the top-level directory of this repo. Typically naming will be `<machine_name>.md`

All screenshots will be in the `/screenshots` directory. Naming will be sequential: `<machine>_0.png`, `machine_1.png`, ..., etc. These screenshots will be embedded into the notes for that machine so idk why anyone would look in that directory.
